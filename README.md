## Hi, I’m Ingrid 👋👩🏻‍💻

I’m a Computer Science student at Purdue University, graduating May 2026, with experience in full-stack development, applied machine learning, and software engineering.
I enjoy building end-to-end systems and working across the stack — from user-facing applications to backend services, data pipelines, and ML-driven solutions.
